Get familiar with serial communication. Use Github to manage changes.
On 12/31/2017 I added this line and committed the readme on the local clone.
Then I did a git push.
That was a mistake, as it pushed the changed file onto the master branch.
Try again. First commit these new lines using git. Then do
  git push origin develop
Note that "develop" is the name of the branch.
